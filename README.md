# Hi there, I'm Betsy Zhang 👋
I recently finished my last class at community college and wanted to begin my journey to becoming a data analyst!  

I am now going to transition this GitHub account to build small relevant projects and remove all my previous ones, which have either been irrelevant/messy/unfinished.  

Feel free to follow me on my DataQuest journey!  

I will also be using GitHub now to build a learning system for myself, now that I am out of school and do not have the structured learning.  I have been pretty ambitious, which backfired and made me burn out, so I am taking a step back and re-evaluating my priorities.  

HMU on Bluesky with any questions. I'll also post life stuff and game-related content there!
